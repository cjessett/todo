## React/Redux Todo App

This is a simple implementation of Redux within a React application that uses websockets via [socket.io](http://socket.io/) to persist data to a [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com/) in realtime.

Make sure you are running the [backend server](https://github.com/cjessett/todo-api) for persisting to the RethinkDB.

Install dependencies

`npm install`

start the dev server

`npm start`
